# divi-child-theme
This child theme is for the Divi Theme by Elegant Themes. It is bare bones with only the necessities. I do include a footer.php file, although not necessary for a child theme, so you are able to modify the "Designed by Elegant Themes, Powered by WordPress" that is the standard Divi footer info. I use this to begin all of my projects. 

#ET added the ability to edit footer credits in Divi 2.7. Footer.php has been deleted.
